# playGuitar

#Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create a mobile/web application that can detect and recognize which guitar string was played in an audio recording.

#Project Tasks:

1. Frontend Development:
    - Create a basic web interface where users can upload an audio file containing a single guitar string sound.
    - Design an interface with an upload button and a result display area.
2. String Detection:
    - Use existing/develop an algorithm that analyzes the uploaded audio file to detect and identify which guitar string was played.
    - Use basic frequency analysis techniques to determine the string.
3. Result Display:
    - Display the detected result (e.g., which guitar string was played).

Stretch Goals:

1. User Friendly UI/UX 
2. Real-time Audio Detection

With this simplified project, there is no need for backend development, making it a frontend-focused exercise. The candidate will create a user interface and implement the string detection algorithm in JavaScript.
